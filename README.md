# CovidIkshana

## Description
Shortage in doctors and medical staff and increasing demand for consultations has lead to a very adverse situation. People who have contracted Covid-19 find it difficult to get consultations from doctors when they need it.  
Our web application mainly focuses on solving this issue by leveraging the use of online platforms like Zoom and Google Meet so that doctors can consult multiple people at once. This is done by using a state of the art AI algorithm to cluster the patients into groups so that patients with similar levels of the disease can be consulted as a group by one doctor. This not only saves the time of the doctors but also ensures that those who are in need gets the right platform for covid consultations. 
Some of the salient features of the website include: 
- Quick checkup

- Round the clock service
- Minimal and intuitive design 
- Easy to use
- Responsive
